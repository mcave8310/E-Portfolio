          <p>In this marketing discussion post, I looked at a service offered by the Cuyahoga County Public Library (CCPL) near Cleveland, OH and analyzed
            the benefits and concerns of the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Memory Lab.  The ability to digitize family records is becoming easier and more
            affordable at the same time as old family records, such as photos, slides, and video, are aging.  By offering and marketing this service to
            the community, CCPL demonstrates its relevancy and value.

        </ul>
        <p>The final research project in LIS 708 was a mixture of group and individual work.  As a group we had to narrow our research topic from an assigned broad
          topic, share our research with the group, and then together create research questions and a survey for our classmates to fill out.  We met weekly to
          discuss our findings and help each other understand complex or confusing ideas.  In this group assignment, each group member was responsible for a
          section of the research question write-up.  Then we came together on Zoom and merged everyone’s writings in a Google Doc.

        </ul>
        <p>My leadership research paper for LIS 707 scrutinized how women in library fields can use their influence and natural tendencies to receive career
          promotions.  I combined my learning from the book <i>The Influence Effect: A New Path to Power for Women Leaders</i> and interviews with two
          librarians from the Library of Congress, which is arguably of the most bureaucratic and business-like libraries, to understand that successful
          leadership for women includes strategically creating relationships and trust at different levels, envisioning future outcomes and responses,
          building a network of support, and marketing yourself and your ideas towards your envisioned goals.
