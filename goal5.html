          <p>When looking at ways to remain relevant, libraries can apply business-like marketing and advocacy principles to promote their value.  In this marketing
            discussion post, I looked at a service offered by the Cuyahoga County Public Library (CCPL) near Cleveland, OH and apply the P’s and C’s of marketing towards
            the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Memory Lab.  In this analysis, I consider how and why this memory lab operates, the community dynamics, corresponding
            library services, the relevancy towards CCPL's strategic goals, and the overall added value.  Since the ability to digitize family records is becoming
            easier and more affordable, other public libraries may see a benefit in offering digitization technology to their users, so it is useful to look at how an
            established memory lab operates.

        </ul>
        <p>The goal of group projects is to demonstrate effective professional communication in a group setting, and are dependent upon effective communication and
          equal participation.  The final research project in LIS 708 was a mixture of group and individual work and was a result of weekly meetings to discuss our
          findings and to help each other understand complex or confusing ideas.  As a group we had to narrow our research topic from an assigned broad subject, share
          our research with the group, and then together create research questions and a survey for our classmates to fill out.  In this assignment, each group member
          was responsible for a section of the research question write-up.  Then we came together on Zoom and merged everyone’s writings in a Google Doc.

        </ul>
        <p>My leadership research paper for LIS 707 demonstrated leadership principles in an educational context about a profession setting.  In my paper, I scrutinized
          how women in library fields can use their influence and natural instincts to earn career promotions.  I combined my learning from the book <i>The Influence Effect:
          A New Path to Power for Women Leaders</i> with interviews from two librarians who work at the Library of Congress, which is arguably one of the most bureaucratic and
          business-like libraries.  I explored how successful leadership for women includes strategically creating relationships and trust at different levels, envisioning
          future outcomes and responses, building a network of support, and marketing yourself and your ideas towards your envisioned goals.  This paper is an example of
          what I hope to achieve in my professional career.
