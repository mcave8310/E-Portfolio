          </ul>
          <p>One of the early discussions in LIS 759 reflected on how to create metadata that is sympathetic to a local community.  As library students,
            we are taught in our classes how to create successful and useful metadata, often utilizing a Western style of description.  However, as
            information professionals we need to understand that native and cultural communities usually view possession, description, and meaning
            differently.  While it is a core value of archives and information environments to expand access and usage opportunities for users and
            archives materials, we need to work with each community on decisions such as who can have access to their historical records, what languages
            are recognized, and where records should be stored.  In addition, as those communities and the world around them evolve, it is important to
            assess whether the core value and ethics continue to meet the needs of diverse environments.

        </ul>
        <p>In this discussion post, I talk about how the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) is a relationship model used by
          library and information professions.  FRBR has an expansive view that allows for future adjustments as the needs of users change.  By allowing
          for the flexibility of locations, cultures, and changing technology, FRBR can guide information management practices in diverse settings for
          both today and the future.  It is important to study and understand diverse library models because as digital records and data increase
          exponentially, users will benefit from the connections made between bibliographic and authority records within the FRBR model.

          <li>Class: LIS 799- Practicum, and Student Worker in the McGreal Center</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My practicum was held in the McGreal Center over the Summer 2021 semester, where I was given the opportunity to work on the Sacred Spaces
        Architecture Project.  The focus of the project is to digitally capture threatened and closed sacred spaces through photographs, panoramas,
        and video, and then preserve them in the form of online digital panorama tours.  My responsibility was to build the front-end design of
        individual audio-visual components so that students after me could follow a documented process (workflow) and quickly drop in photos,
        descriptive information, audio narration and other elements.  At the end of the summer, I was asked to return as a student worker to finish
        the job.  As I successfully built each component, I wrote out directions and then recorded how-to videos that visually demonstrate the
        steps while I narrated the actions.  This is the project that I am most proud of while at Dominican University because it not only combines
        my love for art and design with handling digital archives, but it impelled me to learn HTML coding while creating a distinctive digital project
        that people across the world may view and learn from.
        </p>
        <p>While working on this project in my practicum, I had to utilize previous and newly learned professional skills when communicating with others
        who were a part of each sacred space.  In addition, while much of my work was solo, I was able to strengthen my team skills by asking for
        commentary on my components from others in the archive.  The live, in-person discussions and feedback helped me to understand how users reacted to the
        project and perceived my work.
