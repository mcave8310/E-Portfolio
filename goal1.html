          <p>One of the discussions in LIS 759 reflected on how to create metadata that is sympathetic to a local community.  As information students,
            we are taught in our classes how to create successful and useful metadata, often using the Western style of description.  However, we need
            to understand that native and cultural communities usually view possession, description, and meaning differently.  Instead of imposing a standard
            system of controlled vocabularies and metadata schemas, we need to work with communities on decisions such as who can have access to historical
            records, what languages are recognized, which resources to use, and where records should be stored.

          <li>Class: LIS 703- Organization of Knowledge</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this discussion post, I talk about how Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) is a relationship model that is the latest evolution
          following Charles Cutter’s <i>Rules for a Dictionary Catalogue</i> from the late 19th century and Seymour Lubetzky’s <i>Cataloging Rules and Principles</i>
          from the early 20th century.  FRBR includes the idea of international description since it was devised by an international committee and is not tied
          to any single country’s cataloging standards.  By allowing for the flexibility of locations, cultures, and changing technology, FRBR is a model that
          can adapt to future unknowns.

        </ul>
        <p>My practicum was held in the McGreal Center over the Summer 2021 semester.  Since I have a goal of working with artistic archives, I was fortunate
          to join the Sacred Spaces Architecture Project.  The focus of the project is to digitally capture threatened and closed sacred spaces through photographs,
          panoramas, and video, and then preserve them in the form of online digital panorama tours.  My responsibility was to build the front-end design of
          individual audio-visual components so that students after me could follow a documented process, or workflow, and quickly drop in photos, audio narration
          and other elements.  At the end of the summer, I was asked to return as a student volunteer to finish the job.  As I successfully built each components,
          I wrote out directions and then recorded how-to videos that visually show the steps while I narrated the actions.  This is the project that I am most proud
          of while at Dominican University because it not only combines my love for art and design with handling digital archives, but I also had to learn HTML coding
          while creating a distinctive digital project that people across the world may view and learn from.
