          </ul>
          <p>Archivists and libraries have much in common with businesses and often rely upon Records and Information Management (RIM) plans.  The final project
            for LIS 886 was to create a RIM program plan for a fictional university that was similar to Dominican University.  I was expected to distinguish between
            urgent and long-term problems as well as address the needs of the program at thirty days, ninety days, and one year.  This plan incorporated laws and
            policy standards for PII (personally identifiable information), access controls, retention schedules, and digital security.  Further, I also addressed
            the need to incorporate the Archives Department when creating the university retention schedule and disposition plan, and necessity of maintaining a
            disaster response plan.

        </ul>
        <p>This discussion post provides an overview of linked data and its benefits.  As an emerging technology, it has yet to be embraced by the wider library
          and archival community.  Incorporating linked data into an existing catalog would improve searchability with machine-readability content by instilling
          controlled vocabularies and fixing broken links between hyperlinks and webpages.

          <li>Class: LIS 702- Facilitating User Learning and Information Needs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In LIS 702 we were asked to teach something and create an accompanying LibGuide.  For my lesson, I taught how to fold an accordion book from one sheet
          of paper.  My LibGuide included the instruction sheet from my lesson that I drew by hand, but went further and explored other methods and styles of
          bookbinding for all ages.  As information professionals it is important to relate a project or search result to the individual user.  My lesson and
          LibGuide were intended for beginners of all ages and emphasized supplies commonly found around a house.  While I think that it is valuable to teach the
          history of books and of bookbinding, it is more important to relate it to modern times and showing a range of design options and resources.  Not only
          does that demonstrate relevance of the library to the community but it creates an inviting environment.
