            <li>Class: LIS 886- Records and Information Management</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The practice of applying library and information science theories and principles should include maintaining relevancy to the situation.  My final
            project for LIS 886 was to create a RIM program plan that incorporated laws, policy standards, and archival practices for a university similar to Dominican.
            It incorporated matters such as personally identifiable information (PII), access controls, retention schedules, digital security, and disaster response
            planning.  When dealing with competing interests like handling outdated or valuable records, I had to weigh legal requirements versus historic significance
            and at what point departmental responsibility shifted in the retention schedule.  Risk assessments with regard for financial limitations were also included
            for digital security and disaster response planning.  Having the knowledge of how to create a RIM plan, whether for an entire organization or simply a
            collection, is a practical and required professional skill that an employer might ask of me.

          <li>Class: LIS 882- Metadata for Digital Resources</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One emerging technology that is working to meet the information needs of diverse communities is linked data.  In this discussion post I provide an overview of
          linked data and its benefits for making web discoverability easier by involving RDF principles and XML encoding for sharing metadata between organizations with
          machine reading.  I learned that linked data allows us to replace our use of fallible hyperlinks with structured URLs.  It can especially be used in conjunction
          with existing catalog records by connecting name authority, relationship, and access point information with existing data that might be missing for minority and non-Western
          subject matters.

          <li>Class: LIS 702- Facilitating User Learning and Information Needs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In LIS 702 we were asked to teach something and create an accompanying LibGuide.  For my lesson, I taught how to fold an accordion book from one sheet of
          paper.  Though my LibGuide included the instruction sheet from my lesson that I drew by hand, it went further and explored other methods and styles of
          bookbinding for all ages.  As information professionals, it is important to relate a project or search result to the individual user.  My lesson and LibGuide
          were intended for beginners of all ages and emphasized supplies commonly found around a house.  While I think that it is valuable to teach the history of
          books and bookbinding, it is just as important to relate it to modern times and provide a range of resources for different learning types.  I believe that
          a LibGuide like this creates relevancy to the community by bringing the library into each person’s home.
