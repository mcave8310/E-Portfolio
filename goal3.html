            <li>Class: LIS 799- Practicum, and Student Volunteer in the McGreal Center</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In my practicum I asked to work on two different projects, a digital project and an analog collection.  As previously mentioned, the digital
            project was the Sacred Spaces Architecture Project.  The analog collection I worked on was the Sr. Suzanne Noffke papers.  This was a newly
            acquired collection of Sr. Noffke’s research about and translations of St. Catherine of Siena.  It was my responsibility to assess, arrange,
            inventory, and create a finding aid in ArchivesSpace.  Since most of my time with the collection dealt with digitizing the multimedia (ie.
            powerpoint files, floppy discs, homemade DVDs and CDs, and microfilm) due to their deterioration, I returned as a volunteer to continue
            inputting the paper folders into ArchivesSpace.
          </p>
          <p>In order to understand the contents and the significance of the collection, I spend several early hours researching Sr. Noffke, St. Catherine
            and St. Dominic.  That research not only was included in the Finding Aid but helped me as I assessed and arranged the disorganized boxes.

            <li>Class: LIS 889- Digital Curation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In LIS 889, I curated a collection of news articles, websites, podcasts and YouTube videos about how the theatre community has adapted to and overcome
            the challenges to performing during pandemics.  Using the open source web-publishing platform Omeka, I was able to store my digital collection, add
            metadata and files, and create a digital exhibit.  Using this software highlighted how users are reliant on quality navigation.  I found it
            challenging to move around both my collection and exhibit, and had to think diligently about how users would view and access the information.  Since
            this is a born-digital collection, the quality of my metadata played a large role in understanding and viewing the items.

          </ul>
          <p>An EAD finding aid is an archival standard when working with collections.  With the advancement of technology and the gaining prevalence of
            born-digital collections, EAD3 is the latest version that includes linked data, EAC-CPF, international standards, and multilingual records.
            In Advanced Archives I compared the five main areas that changed between EAD 2002 and EAD3.
