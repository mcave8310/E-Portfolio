          <p>For my final project in LIS 753, I coded this e-Portfolio.  It is important when designing resources and tools that facilitate access to information,
            especially for online usage, that they are designed to meet a purpose, are appropriate for the intended user, and incorporate responsive design for diverse
            types of devices.  This e-Portfolio was coded and validated to be visually pleasing to the average user while also accounting for accessibility users who
            depend on alternative text and colors.  While my portfolio is best viewed on a laptop or desktop monitor, there is some responsive design for viewing on a
            small device such as a tablet.  Each individual page is also titled so that it clearly states the information that it contains.  Further, the navigation
            bar at the top is repeated at the bottom so that the user does not have to scroll back up the top in order to visit another page.

            <li>Class: LIS 889- Digital Curation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In LIS 889, I curated a collection of news articles, websites, podcasts and YouTube videos about how the theatre community has adapted to and overcome
            the challenges to performing during pandemics.  Using the open source web-publishing platform Omeka, I was able to store my digital collection, add
            metadata and files, and create a digital exhibit.  While using this software, I became aware of how users are reliant on quality navigation.  I found
            it challenging to move around both my collection and exhibit, and had to think diligently about how users would view and access the information.  Since
            this is a born-digital collection, the quality of my metadata played a large role in understanding and viewing the items.  Like with many other digital
            projects, I have found that it is important how I am familiar with the software so that I can utilize its features to produce a better product.  Despite
            using an older version of Omeka in class, this project allowed me to develop experience with the basic software layout and operation of actions.

          <p>When evaluating resources or tools that manage and facilitate access to information, it is important to not only assess the purpose and desired results
            of the goal, but also how well we are will be able to utilize the tool.  This includes information and archival standards such as EAD.  In this report from
            LIS 881, I compared the five main areas that changed between EAD 2002 and EAD3.  It is not only important to understand a standard’s original guidelines, but
            as information professionals, we need to keep up with the how and why of changes as new versions of standards are published.  This, in turn, will also allow
            us remain relevant and acquainted with technology improvements and terminology changes.
