          <p>	For my final project in LIS 753, I coded this e-Portfolio.  It is important when designing resources or tools that facilitate access to information that
            they are designed to meet a purpose and appropriate for the intended user.  This e-Portfolio was coded and validated to be visually pleasing to the average
            user while also accounting for accessibility users who depend on alternative text and colors.  Each individual page also is titled so that it clearly states
            the information  that it contains.  Further, the navigation bar at the top is repeated at the bottom so that the user does not have to scroll back up the
            top in order to go to another page.

            <li>Class: LIS 889- Digital Curation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>	In LIS 889, I curated a collection of news articles, websites, podcasts and YouTube videos about how the theatre community has adapted to and overcome
            the challenges to performing during pandemics.  Using the open source web-publishing platform Omeka, I was able to store my digital collection, add
            metadata and files, and create a digital exhibit.  While using this software, I became aware of how users are reliant on quality navigation.  I found
            it challenging to move around both my collection and exhibit, and had to think diligently about how users would view and access the information.  Since
            this is a born-digital collection, the quality of my metadata played a large role in understanding and viewing the items.  Like with many other digital
            projects, I have found that it is important that I am familiar with the software so that I can utilize its features to produce a better product.  Despite
            using an older version of Omeka in class, this project allowed me to develop experience with the basic software layout and operation of actions.

          <p>An EAD finding aid is an archival standard when working with collections.  With the advancement of technology and the gaining prevalence of
            born-digital collections, EAD3 is the latest version that includes linked data, EAC-CPF, international standards, and multilingual records.
            In Advanced Archives I compared the five main areas that changed between EAD 2002 and EAD3.
