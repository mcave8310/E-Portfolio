            <li>Class: LIS 882- Metadata for Digital Resources</li>
          </ul>
          <p>While most of my time in the MLIS program has dealt with digital archives, the backbone to managing information is understanding and accurately creating
            metadata, and is similar for analog and digital records.  In this discussion post I provide summaries of four different definitions of metadata from the
            week’s readings, and also the outcomes if the different interpretations were applied to the same information.  As an information professional, it is important
            to be aware of various definitions and concepts of information in order to understand how to apply them to different situations.  It is often most useful to
            apply the same processes to similar materials in order to improve user searchability while ensuring trust in accuracy and validity of the information.
            However, care has to be taken to evaluate each record or collection for their individual qualities and determine when the metadata should deviate.

          <li>Class: LIS 701- Core Values, Ethics, and Issues in the Library and Information Professions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For my LIS 701 research paper, I explored how copyright law has historically impacted creativity and design, as well as the permission alternatives that
          are emerging as technology advances.  By learning about the history of copyright and how current technologies are impacting our laws, it is important to
          guide users to comprehensive information so they can continue to use and benefit from their works in the future.  As information professionals, we may have
          a responsibility to explain the impact of information policies on their intellectual freedom, access, and other aspects of their lives.  In the case of
          copyright law, many users unwittingly, or otherwise, depend on Fair Use and may need some instruction to better understand the consequences of their actions.
          Similarly, we need to understand how those laws and regulations directly impact or target library and information science areas, and how to appeal when they
          become too restrictive or fail to keep up with technology changes.

        <li>Class: LIS 702- Facilitating User Learning and Information Needs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My classes in my first semester included several early discussions about how to include diverse communities in a library.  Consequently, when I was given
          the opportunity, I took advantage of submitting an essay in a non-traditional format.  I used this opportunity to learn how to record audio narration on a
          computer by creating a podcast since many users may not read English well.
        </p>
        <p>As an information professional, it is important to develop appropriate responses to assessed information needs within diverse communities.  This diversity
          essay highlights how various areas of a person’s identity are interwoven to make up their intersectionality and that librarians need to be aware of the seen a
          nd hidden diversity within their users.  By developing appropriate responses as information needs are assessed, I will have a sense of how to react to situations
          quicker involving diverse communities.  This subsequently would ideally build trust and create open communication.
