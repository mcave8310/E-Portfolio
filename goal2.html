            <li>Class: LIS 882- Metadata for Digital Resources</li>
          </ul>
          <p>While most of my time in the MLIS program has dealt with digital archives, the backbone to managing information is understanding and accurately
            creating metadata and is similar for analog and digital records.  In this discussion post I provide summaries of four different definitions of
            metadata from the week’s readings and the outcomes if the different interpretations were applied to the same information.  As an information
            professional, it is important to apply the same processes to similar materials in order to improve searchability for the user while ensuring trust
            in the information.  However, it is also important to evaluate each record or collection for their individual qualities and determine when the metadata
            should deviate.

        <p>For my LIS 701 research paper, I explored how copyright law has historically impacted creativity and design, and the alternatives that are emerging.
          As a life-long artist, I think it is important to understand how to protect your art from others at the same time as avoiding copyright infringement
          of other’s works.  By learning about the history of copyright and how current technologies are impacting our laws to protect the publishers at the expense
          of the creators, it is important to guide users to comprehensive information so they can continue to use and benefit from their works into the future.

        <li>Class: LIS 702- Facilitating User Learning and Information Needs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My classes in my first semester included several early discussions about how to include diverse communities in a library.  Consequently, when I
          was given the opportunity, I took advantage of submitting an essay in a non-traditional format.  I used this opportunity to learn how to record
          audio narration on a computer since many users may not read or understand English well.
        </p>
        <p>This diversity essay was written and presented as a podcast.  It highlights how various areas of a person’s identity are interwoven to make up
          their intersectionality.  I point out that librarians and, more broadly, information professions, may unconsciously rely on their own experiences
          to select materials and collections.  To break those invisible privilege barriers and create a welcoming environment, we need to assess how different
          groups within a local community may view incorrect stereotypes or missing identities, and then consciously shift towards diversifying our collections
          and information.
