        <h5>MLIS Reflective Essay</h5>
        <p class="essay">I applied to Dominican University in May 2019 because I witnessed an archival and cultural wrongdoing a few years prior and I wanted to learn how to prevent
          it in the future.  After working for the Joffrey Ballet for seven years, the new management at the company decided to create a new Nutcracker and sent the
          founder’s final ballet to the landfill.  When I became aware that there had been little attempt over the years to preserve the original technical documents,
          and thus ensuring extraordinary difficulty in ever recreating the production again, I realized that there was a need for better preservation and archiving in
          the theatre world.  While I came into the program thinking that I would focus on physical objects, I have since realized that there are more opportunities to
          work with digital items and files.  This shift is reflected in the courses I have taken, and in recently discovering that I had completed the Digital Curation
          certificate without planning for it.  Many of the projects from those digital-based classes are featured in this e-portfolio, including this website.
        </p>
        <h5>My Journey through the MLIS program</h5>
        <p class="essay">Throughout my three years in the program, I have focused much of my studies in the areas of archives and digital records.  I came to the program
          knowing that like much of our society, the arts was transitioning from paper to digital records.  Since my experiences had shown me how easy it was to not
          only misplace paper records, but to lose their significance with staff turnover, I started my MLIS journey with a focus towards physical records and learning
          about descriptive metadata.  However, along the way, I came to understand that the future of archives and preservation is digital, whether digitizing physical
          records or managing born-digital files.  As digital information continues to grow exponentially, I recognize that information professionals will become an
          essential part towards ensuring the integrity, reliability, and usability of digital files, whether locating information for a library user, preserving our
          artistic culture, or creating a RIM plan for a corporate employer.
        </p>
        <h5>The Five Learning Goals</h5>
        <p class="essay">My growth through Dominican University can be viewed as a reflection of the five  learning goals.  The courses I have taken have introduced me
          to new ideas, such as professional organizations, ethics, diversity, and business marketing.  Together with the learning goals, these have helped to reshape
          my view of the identity of libraries, librarians, and information professionals, and what they represent.
        </p>
        <p class="essay">When looking at <i>Goal 1: Develop a professional identity and philosophy within the library and information professions</i>, I came to
          comprehend in my first semesters that my childhood view of libraries and librarians was outdated.  It no longer was just a place where librarians kept
          books organized and helped a user find them.  Instead, libraries had transformed into knowledge centers with services, tools, and interaction that
          corresponded with technology advancements.  My artifacts for Outcomes 1a and 1b reflect this relevancy by correlating core values and information models with
          the needs of the users in order to remain flexible to the community.  I know that my professional identity and philosophy will be impacted by the makeup of
          the immediate community’s core values, culture, and technology adoption.
        </p>
        <p class="essay">Further, dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic has shown me the value of libraries and information centers during challenging times.  When
          libraries and archives were closed for several months in 2020, I experienceed how their digital and online substitutes became an essential part to staying
          relevant with the community.  As the consequences of the pandemic continue to further strain budgets, projects like the McGreal Center’s Sacred Spaces
          Architecture Project (Outcome 1c) will become critical to preserving spaces digitally when they are no longer financially affordable.  This is also the
          project that I am most proud from my academic career for several reasons.  First, it combined my love for art and architecture with applying my classroom
          learning to real-life records.  Second, through working on this project, first during my practicum and then as a student worker, I experienced the majority
          of the life cycle of a newly conceived digital project: from creating new archival records, to developing the workflow processes and designing the front-end
          user features, to receiving and applying user feedback.  Above all other projects and artifacts, the Sacred Spaces Architecture Project, as my culmination
          project with digital records, has most helped me to define the direction I would like to take my professional identity.
        </p>
        <p class="essay">For <i>Goal 2: Understand the essential nature of information and its relevance to our diverse society</i>, I recognize that as an information
          professional it is important I understand how others interpret information.  My artifacts in Outcomes 2a and 2c demonstrate how I need to consider varying
          definitions and personal identities.  While I came into the program knowing that descriptive metadata was important for defining a record, my equality podcast
          (Outcome 2c) allowed me to explore how the essential nature of information can be interpreted through distinctive perspectives, or intersectionalities.
          Though information may appear as unbiased, our interpretations can influence its reception and impact.
        </p>
        <p class="essay">While some artifacts in my portfolio, such as from Outcomes 2a and 2c, are symbolic of how much I learned while writing them, others were
          created because I used them as opportunities to learn more about a topic.  Outcome 2b, my LIS 701 Research Paper, was my first major research project in
          the MLIS program.  As an older student who had not written anything of length for over fifteen years, this proved especially challenging since not only did
          I have to remember how to write a research paper, but I also had to learn about the complexities of copyright law for librarians and artists.  This project
          necessitated a detail examination of what specific information would be most useful to a diverse audience.
        </p>
        <p class="essay">Before coming to Dominican University, I thought that I was fairly proficient with technology.  However, after looking back on my advancement
          through the program, I see how little I knew of broad digital skills.  <i>Goal 3: Navigate, curate and create information across the spectrum of human
          records</i>, is where I believe I have grown the most, particularly with website building.  That is the one tool that I have been most exposed to, with each
          experience increasingly more challenging that previous ones.  My first experience with creating a website, involved using Weebly for an LIS 759 collection. I
          initially struggled to setup multiple pages because I had to understand the nature of how websites and internal webpages are connected.  After that initial
          web-building project, it became easier to understand the process and layout of different platforms or programs, such as with Omeka (Outcome 3b).  Additionally,
          I became more aware of how a viewer would navigate through and react to information, and so I worked to create a positive experience despite any software
          limitations.  Finally, learning how to code HTML not only allowed me to design and code my own websites and pages using GitHub, but also improved my speed and
          complexity within Pano2VR for the Sacred Spaces Architecture Project.
        </p>
        <p class="essay">Beyond websites, some other skills I have acquired over the past three years involve audio, video, and image files.  I started off learning
          how to record audio files on my computer and then later advanced to editing videos with and without narration.  In the process, I learned that it was easier
          to assemble a video when the video and audio were recorded separately.   When it came to image files, I had several opportunities to archive webpages in
          different formats, including saving an individual webpage as a long single page PDF versus saving an entire website as their individual pages and content
          linked together.  My photo and image experiences continued in the McGreal Center when I learned how to use Adobe programs Photoshop, Lightroom, and Illustrator
          to enhance drone footage and create floor plan maps for the architecture tours.  I also learned how to combine a series of different exposures using
          high-dynamic range (HDR) technology to create a hybrid image to exhibit an architecture’s maximum detail.
        </p>
        <p class="essay">The real test to learning library and information theory is applying it to real-life situations.  Several artifacts for <i>Goal 4: Synthesize
          theory and practice within a dynamic, evolving, and diverse information environment</i> connect theory to real-world situations in the classroom, such as
          with my artifacts for Outcomes 4a and 4c.  Those artifacts are also symbolic of how much I learned while creating them.  My RIM Program Plan (Outcome 4a) for
          LIS 886 and my LibGuide (Outcome 4c) for LIS 702 are two documents that I had never heard of before those classes.  In order to complete them, I first had
          to understand their purpose, perceive of what an intended audience would desire to learn, and recognize which components were required to meet those needs.
          My LibGuide was also connected to designing a related lesson plan and then teaching it.  While teaching my classmates how to fold a book from a single sheet
          of paper, I learned a different lesson: that not everyone has the same ability level at folding paper and following verbal instructions.  Also, I learned that
          instruction takes practice since teaching my lesson to one person was not the same as teaching twenty people all at once.
        </p>
        <p class="essay">Another example of how I connected classroom theory with a dynamic environment was creating a finding aid in ArchivesSpace for the Sr. Suzanne
          Noffke Papers.  After exploring how to arrange and describe a collection in LIS 775 and then utilize ArchivesSpace in LIS 881, I was to able to combine them
          when working on this collection in the McGreal Center.  Some of the challenges associated with this collection included figuring out the original order since
          care was not taken in boxing up Sr. Noffke’s office, following archival protocols for social security numbers and personally identifiable information (PII),
          and addressing conservation and preservation issues when dealing with aging paper and film.
        </p>
        <p class="essay"><i>Goal 5: Effectively communicate and collaborate to deliver, market, and advocate for library and information services</i>, asks me to
          synthesize the previous four goals and apply them looking forward.  Just like with Goal 1, working towards an MLIS during the pandemic has shown me the
          importance of providing value and relevancy to potential stakeholders.  My artifacts for Goal 5 include examining a current library service (Outcome 5a),
          creating a research survey in a group setting (Outcome 5b), and exploring successful leadership strategies for women in library science positions (Outcome
          5c).  When it comes to marketing and advocating, whether for yourself, an idea, or an organization, the most consequential choice is to stay relevant to the
          community, potential employers, or donors.  As libraries are expected to do more with less funding, it is important to assess whether services are reaching
          the intending audience and fulfilling their purpose.   For Outcome 5a, I determined that the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Memory Lab was designed with the
          knowledge that Cuyahoga County’s demographics were changing, so the equipment and training reflect the average age of the community and types of aging
          audiovisual formats.  In LIS 707, we discussed how to market yourself for employment in a library career by creating an elevator pitch and applying skillsets
          from seemingly unrelated situations.  For Outcome 5c, I interviewed two librarians from the Library of Congress on how they manage and thrive in a bureaucratic
          library setting and then considered how I could apply their strategies to my career.
        </p>
        <h5>SOIS Experience</h5>
        <p class="essay">Beyond the five learning goals, several SOIS courses have impacted my learning above others.   The three courses, Advanced Archives (LIS 881),
          Metadata for Digital Records (LIS 882), and Records and Information Management (LIS 886), became my foundation for understanding different standards, models,
          and laws that govern records and information.  They were also the catalysts to realizing that I needed to focus on digital instead of physical records.  As
          \much as I enjoy working with my hands and with tangible objects, there is and will continue to be a greater need for archivists and information professionals
          who understand the challenges and limitations of digital records.
        </p>
        <p class="essay">I came to Dominican University in part for the face-to-face experience of working and learning with others.  Despite our world having other
          plans, some of my most meaningful experiences were in person.  In my first semester, my LIS 702 group project included involving the entire class in a Google
          Doc activity.  Not only did I experience working with others from my group with different backgrounds, ages, and computer experience levels, but I learned
          about planning for the unexpected and accepting when your plan has set backs or failures.  Now in my final semester, I am once again attending a couple
          face-to-face classes, but this time only in the form of in-person field trips to archives to look at rare and historic records.  The opportunity to look at
          and/or touch books and materials that are hundreds of years old feels like a fitting finale to what turned out to be a mostly digital academic career.
        </p>
        <h5>Future career goals</h5>
        <p class="essay">I will be graduating from Dominican University with the same career goal that I arrived with: With a desire to assist artists and performance
          companies with preserving their works, not only for their own records, but to preserve and share our culture’s history.  Since I see the future of that in
          digitization and working with electronic records, in the next several years I need to continue gaining hands-on experience working with digital files and
          building online tools.  I especially anticipate working with photographs and digital images in the creation of tools that will help users find information
          and immerse themselves in exhibit experiences.
        </p>
        <p class="essay">This e-Portfolio reflects my changes as I have progressed through my MLIS program.  I started with a focus that was based on my previous career
          observations and ended by adventuring into digital archives and exhibits.  Along the way I gained an appreciation for accurate and well-designed metadata, as
          well as the benefits to understanding how to market yourself and your projects, no matter the intended audience.  I look forward to my future and am excited for
          the next archival innovations that will come from our digital and online technologies.
